    * Fixed a serious defect where API parameters, such as search text, must 
      be URL-escaped. There's a catch if you tried previously to use CGI.escape
      to work around, though: Flickr's API signature string must not be *escaped*
      before the string is MD5-checksummed.
      
      Now everything should work fine. Pass any CJKV or HTML entity characters
      to see how it goes!


2007-01-04 (0.9.3):
    * These methods from FlickrPhoto are deprecated:
    
	  * FlickrPhoto.unique_id_from_hash(params, prefix)
	  * FlickrPhoto.url_from_unique_id(uid)
	  * FlickrPhoto.hash_from_unique_id(uid)
	  
	  Instead, please call them by these new names:
	  
	  * FlickrPhoto.element_id_from_hash(params, prefix)
	  * FlickrPhoto.url_from_element_id(uid)
	  * FlickrPhoto.hash_from_element_id(uid)
	  
	  This is for the sake of naming consistency. "Element id" is more 
	  web design talk. Henceforth the change.
	  

2006-12-27 (0.9.2):
	* Added support for Flickr's new "farm" part newly found in its photo URLs
	
	* Your code needs no change, everything will just work, including
	  those photo URL/div id helpers, but on the other hand...
	  
	* Deprecated methods in FlickrInvocation:

	  * photo_url(params)
	  * photo_div_id(params, prefix='photo')
	  * photo_url_from_div_id(uid)
	  * photo_info_from_div_id(uid)
	 
	  Those are methods that should never go into an invocation object.
	  Instead they belong to a helper, so:
	
	* Created a FlickrPhoto module

  	  FlickrPhoto.url_from_hash(params)
	  FlickrPhoto.unique_id_from_hash(params, prefix)
	  FlickrPhoto.url_from_unique_id(uid)
	  FlickrPhoto.hash_from_unique_id(uid)

	  Those helper functions now take place of their deprecated
	  predecessors.
	  
    * Before :server_id and :server were both accepted hash key
      for the "param" in those helper functions, now only :server
      is accepted. This is in accordance with Flickr's own
      naming convention.
      
    * You no longer need to set :auth=>true if you already supply
      an :auth_token parameter when you make Flickr method calls.
      Since :auth_token always implies that the call must be
      authenticated, ObjectiveFlickr is happy to save a few strokes
      for you. :)
